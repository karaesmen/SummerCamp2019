## Introduction

Hi there! My name is Ezgi Karaesmen, but you can just call me "Ez". I am a PhD student at the OSU College of Pharmacy and I love working with data. You can find more information about me [here](https://ezgi-karaesmen.netlify.com) and feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

Let's get started!

In this activity, you will learn how to explore a publicly available dataset using R programming.

### What is R?

Google the letter "R", what do you think you will get?  

The first result is almost always **R: The R Project for Statistical Computing**.  

R is an open-source programming language for computing, statistics, modeling, and graphical analysis. With its great reliability and versatility, R is now ranked the most popular data science tool and the sixth most popular programming language in the world.  

Top-tier companies use R. Facebook, Google, Twitter, Microsoft, Uber, Airbnb...use R to perform user behavior analysis, advertising effectiveness, data visualization, risk modeling, and much more.

The best part, it is easy to get started with R. You don't need to be a programmer. R was created to allow you to use powerful computational tools with intuitive, simple commands.    

Go to next topic to see how you will execute code for today's exercises.

## R Coding Space

Throughout this module, you will practice coding in the **R coding space** (shown below). This special text box allows you to communicate with R. The black texts inside are **code**, which is a sequence of **commands** to carry out certain tasks. The green texts starting with the hashtag (#) are **comments**, which are explanations for humans to understand the code. R will ignore them when you run the code. 

You will use the R coding space in several ways: 1) to study examples, 2) to complete coding exercises, 3) to code on your own from scratch. Follow the instructions below to get familiar with the R coding space.

### **Study Examples**  

* Click the **Run Code** button at the top-right corner, then you will see the outputs below the R coding space. 
* You can change the code, run it again, and check how the outputs change. Now try these in the next code space     
    + Change `x = -30:30` to `x = -20:40`, click Run Code again, check how the graph changes; 
    + Change `y = x ^ 2` to `y = x ^ 3`, rerun it, and see what happens;
    + Change `"deepskyblue"` to `"violet"`, rerun it, and see what you've got;   
    + Change `"My Graph"` to some title you like (make sure to enclose with parentheses), rerun and check your new title.  

  
* To restore the example code, click **Start Over** at the top-left corner.  

```{r r-coding-space, exercise = TRUE}
# ---------- EXAMPLE ----------
# create variable `x` and assign a sequence of numbers
x = -30:30
# create variable `y` and assign the squared values of variable `x`
y = x ^ 2
# plot y over x
plot(x, y, col = "deepskyblue", main = "My Graph", pch=)

```
<br>

**Coding Exercises**  

You will complete coding exercises throughout the project. The coding space below shows an example. These exercises have three components:

*Instruction*  

- The comments (e.g., "Create variable 'x'...") give you instructions on what code to write. You can write your code right below the comments.  

*Hint*  

- If you need help, click the **Hint** button at the top, a **hint window** will show up with **partial code** and additional instructions to help you complete the code (e.g., `1:60` generates a sequence from 1 to 60).  
- If you would like to copy the partial code, click the **Copy to Clipboard** button at the top-right corner of the hint window, and paste it to the coding space (right-click and paste, Control+V on Windows, or Command+V on Mac).  
- The partial code contains underscores (____) to indicate blanks to fill. Make sure you remove the underscores before running the code.  

*Solution*  

- To see a sample solution, click **Next Hint** at the top of the hint window. Once you see the solution, you cannot go back to the hint.  
- Some exercises do not provide sample solutions. In that case, you can ask the teacher to check your work or compare your work with your partner's.

```{r exercise, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 10}
# ---------- EXERCISE ----------
# Create variable `x` and assign a sequence of numbers 1 to 60


# Create variable `y` and assign the square roots of values in variable `x`


# Plot y over x, choose your favorite color, and create a title


```

```{r exercise-hint-1}
# ---------- EXERCISE ----------
# Create variable `x` and assign a sequence of numbers 1 to 60
# HINT: `1:60` generates a sequence from 1 to 60 
# x = ______

# Create variable `y` and assign the square roots of values in variable `x`
# HINT: use the `sqrt()` function
# y = ______

# Plot y over x, choose your favorite color, and create a title.
# HINT: x for x-axis, y for y-axis
# plot(_____, _____, col = "______", main = "______")
```

```{r exercise-solution}
# ---------- EXERCISE ----------
# Create variable `x` and assign a sequence of numbers 1 to 60
x = 1:60

# Create variable `y` and assign the square roots of values in variable `x`
y = sqrt(x)

# Plot y over x, choose your favorite color, and create a title
plot(x, y, col = "forestgreen", main = "Square Root")

```

**From Scratch**

As you develop more skills, you can start to write your own code from scratch.
You can use **My Code** on the next page to experiment ideas, combine code snippets, and run longer code.

## NEISS Data

```{r burning_img, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap="https://www.dolmanlaw.com/product-liability-claims-in-florida/", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_glossy,ret_img,w_768/https://www.dolmanlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Product-Liability-Claims-in-Florida-768x512.jpg')
```

Today we will work with National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) dataset. NEISS is operated by Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) which aims to protect public from unsafe products (like laptops that catch on fire unexpectedly due to production errors). The primary purpose of NEISS is to collect data on consumer product-related injuries occurring in the United States. CPSC then uses this data to estimate product-related injuries and take necessary action. But since 2000, CPSC expanded NEISS to collect all injuries and NEISS has become an important public health research tool. You can find more information about NEISS [here](https://www.cpsc.gov/Research--Statistics/NEISS-Injury-Data/).


## Take a look at injury dataset

Today we will work with a large dataset called `injury_data`. As such we cannot simply look at all of it, otherwise it would fill our entire screen with a lot of words and numbers! So to understand what kind of information is contained in a dataset, we usually take a look at the top several rows. It may also be a better idea to understand how many rows and columns a dataset has before doing operations with it. Let's see how big this dataset is:

**Check number of rows with `nrow()`**

```{r neiss_intro_row, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

# Print the number of rows of a dataset
```

```{r neiss_intro_row-hint}

# HINT: Use nrow() function
# nrow(_____)
```

```{r neiss_intro_row-solution}

# nrow(injury_data)
```

**Check number of columns with `ncol()`**

```{r neiss_intro_col, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

# Check the number of columns

```

```{r neiss_intro_col-hint}

# HINT: Use ncol() function
# ncol(_____)
```

```{r neiss_intro_col-solution}

# HINT: Use ncol() function
ncol(injury_data)
```


**Look at first 6 rows with `head()`**

```{r neiss_intro_head, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

# Look at first 6 rows
```


```{r neiss_intro_head-hint}

# HINT: Use head() function
# head(____)
```

```{r neiss_intro_head-solution}

# HINT: Use head() function
head(injury_data)
```


Because `injury_data` has more columns than what can be fit to the screen, table output shows only some of them. You can click on **right and left arrows** on top of the table to see other columns. You can also see which columns are shown on the bottom of the table. 

Alternatively you can also use `colnames()` to see a list of all column names in the dataset.

```{r neiss_intro_colnames, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 3}

# Print column names

```

```{r neiss_intro_colnames-hint}

# HINT: Use colnames() function
# colnames(____)

```

```{r neiss_intro_colnames-solution}

# Print column names
colnames(injury_data)
```


**Are the column names clear? Discuss with your group what type of information is contained in this dataset.**

See if you can now answer the following questions:

```{r neiss-intro-quiz}
quiz(
  question("How many rows does `injury_data` has?",
    answer("543,728"),
    answer("42,368"),
    answer("1,865,651", correct = TRUE),
    answer("3,85")
  ),
   question("How many columns does `injury_data` has?",
    answer("6,832"),
    answer("14", correct = TRUE),
    answer("1,865,651"),
    answer("8")
  ),
     question("What type of information **cannot** be obtained from this dataset?",
    answer("Age of the patient"),
    answer("Body part that was injured"),
    answer("Name of the patient", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Description of the accident from the hospital"),
    answer("Location of the hospital", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Product/object involved in the injury"),
    type = "multiple",
    allow_retry =TRUE
  )

)
```

**Find the date range of the dataset**

You can see that there is a `date` column in the dataset, giving the date of the accident. Let's find out between which dates this data was collected.   

- Run the following code to get the first and last days included in the data. Look at the code and discuss with your group what you think the code is doing.      
- Then remove `first_day =` and `last_day =` and run again.

```{r date_exercise, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 6}

# Run the code to get first and last days of the data
# then remove `first_day =` and `last_day =` and run again.
injury_data %>%
  summarise(first_day = min(date),
            last_day = max(date))

```

```{r date_exercise-hint}

injury_data %>%
  summarise(min(date), max(date))

```

What happened? 

<br>

- Now get the time difference between these dates. How many days were recorded in the dataset? *Hint: You can do simple math operations in the `summarise()` function.*


```{r date_exercise2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}

# Get the time difference 
# between first and last day in the data

```


```{r date_exercise2-hint}

# Hint: You can do simple math operations in the `summarise()` function
# injury_data %>%
#  summarise(____ - ____)

```

```{r date_exercise2-solution}

# Hint: You can do simple math operations in the `summarise()` function
injury_data %>%
  summarise(min(date) - max(date))

```

```{r date-quiz}
quiz(
  question("How many days were recorded in `injury_data`?",
    answer("543,728"),
    answer("756"),
    answer("1,825", correct = TRUE),
    answer("3,549")
  ))
```

<br>

How many years are **1825** days? You can also do simple math in R.

```{r years_ex, exercise =TRUE, exercise.lines = 4}
# How many years is 1825 days?
```

```{r years_ex-hint}
# 1825 / ____
```


## What?! Where?? How? 

```{r injury_img, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap="Photo courtesy Getty Images", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics('https://globalsportmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Childrens-sports-injuries.jpg')
```


Imagine you're injured during practice, your friend calls your parents and tells them that you were injured. What do you think their reaction would be? They probably would like to find out what part of your body was injured, how serious it is and where you are at the moment. 

Let's see if we can get some answers for these burning questions from the our dataset `injury_data`. 

In the code chunk below we start asking the question **where** most accidents happen. To answer this we will:       

1. Group all observations (rows of the table) by the categories in `location` column  
2. Sum the number of injuries given in the `n_injuries` column   
3. Pick top 10 with most number of injuries   
4. Arrange our results in descending order

Look at the code, does it make sense?

```{r location_ex, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8, message=FALSE}
# Run the code to find out where most injuries happen?
injury_data %>% 
  group_by(location) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-number_of_injuries)
```

While we can now see the top locations where people are most frequently  injured, human brains aren't very good at simply looking at numbers and comparing them. We do much better when we turn such results into plots and have a visual representation. Let's add some more code to turn these results into a bar plot!    

<!-- ```{r location_ex2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8, message=FALSE} -->
<!-- # Assign the result to a variable called `location_top10` -->
<!-- injury_data %>%  -->
<!--   group_by(location) %>%  -->
<!--   summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>%  -->
<!--   top_n(10) %>% -->
<!--   arrange(-number_of_injuries) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r location_ex2-hint} -->
<!-- # HINT: use assignment sign `<-`  -->
<!-- location_top10 <- injury_data %>%  -->
<!--   group_by(location) %>%  -->
<!--   summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>%  -->
<!--   top_n(10) %>% -->
<!--   arrange(-number_of_injuries) -->

<!-- location_top10 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Now let's make bar plots with our new variable! -->

<!-- ```{r location_plot-setup} -->
<!-- location_top10 <- injury_data %>%  -->
<!--   group_by(location) %>%  -->
<!--   summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>%  -->
<!--   top_n(10) %>% -->
<!--   arrange(-number_of_injuries) -->

<!-- ``` -->


```{r location_plot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=10, message=FALSE}
# Run the code to make a bar plot
injury_data %>% 
  group_by(location) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-number_of_injuries) %>% 
  # up until here we have the same exact code from before
  # code below makes the plot
  ggplot(aes(reorder(location, number_of_injuries), number_of_injuries)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+  
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of injuries")
```

Wow! Looks so much better!

**Now let use the same code to explore other things in our dataset.**     

We are still very curious about most frequently injured body parts and most frequently observed injury diagnosis. All you need to do is now group the dataset by `body_part` or `diagnosis`. You need to make small changes in the code below to get results. See if you can figure it out! Click on **Hints** to get hints!

```{r body_bp, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=14, message=FALSE}

# Change the code to get results for body_part
injury_data %>% 
  group_by(location) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-number_of_injuries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(location, number_of_injuries), number_of_injuries)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+  
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of injuries")
```

```{r body_bp-hint-1, message=FALSE}
# Where do you see `location` in the code? 
# injury_data %>% 
#   group_by(____) %>% 
#   summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
#   top_n(10) %>%
#   arrange(-number_of_injuries) %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(reorder(____, number_of_injuries), 
#              number_of_injuries)) +
#   geom_col() +
#   coord_flip() +
#   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+  
#   xlab("") +
#   ylab("Number of injuries")
```

```{r body_bp-hint-2, message=FALSE}
# Replace any `location` in the code with `body_part`
injury_data %>% 
  group_by(body_part) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-number_of_injuries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(body_part, number_of_injuries), number_of_injuries)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+  
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of injuries")
```

<br>

Now do the same thing for diagnosis!

```{r diag_bp, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=14, message=FALSE}
# Change the code to get results for diagnosis
injury_data %>% 
  group_by(location) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-number_of_injuries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(location, number_of_injuries), number_of_injuries)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+  
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of injuries")
```


```{r diag_bp-solution, message=FALSE}
# Replace any `location` in the code with `diagnosis`
injury_data %>% 
  group_by(diagnosis) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-number_of_injuries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(diagnosis, number_of_injuries), number_of_injuries)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+  
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of injuries")
```

Are you not familiar with some of these medical terms in diagnosis? No worries, just Google them! Beware if you want to look at the images though some maybe disturbing!

Now see if you can answer these questions

```{r body_diag-quiz}
quiz(
  question("What is the **3rd** most frequently injured body part?",
    answer("Face"),
    answer("Head"),
    answer("Finger", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Foot"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  ),
    question("What is the most frequently observed diagnosis in the dataset?",
    answer("Fracture"),
    answer("Concussion"),
    answer("Laceration", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Dislocation"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
  )
```


**What about least frequently injured body parts?**
Again all you need is to make some small changes to the code. You don't need to change any of the functions. What do you think you should do?

```{r body_least, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=15}
# Change the code below to get the least injured body parts
injury_data %>% 
  group_by(body_part) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-number_of_injuries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(body_part, number_of_injuries), number_of_injuries)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+  
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of injuries")
```

```{r body_least-hint-1}
# All you need is to add a `-` (minus) sign somewhere!

```

```{r body_least-hint-2}
# All you need is to add a `-` (minus) sign somewhere!
# Just change top_n(10) to top_n(-10)!

injury_data %>% 
  group_by(body_part) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
  top_n(-10) %>%
  arrange(number_of_injuries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(body_part, number_of_injuries), number_of_injuries)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+  
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of injuries")
```

But before we move on to the next section, I want to write a custom function so I wouldn't have to repeat the same code all the time. Because I am always:     

1. Starting with my dataset
1. Grouping it by the column of interest    
1. Getting total number of injuries in each category    
1. Getting top 10 of these most frequent categories
1. Plotting

See the example code below, I turn all these steps into a function that simply accepts the column of interest and does the rest. I named this function `plot_injury_grp_top10`, it is not the most creative and succinct name but helps me remember what it was designed to do. 

Run the code below and change `plot_injury_grp_top10(diagnosis)` to body_part, location or sex to see if the function is working properly.

```{r func, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines = 20}
plot_injury_grp_top10 <- function(my_data, my_column){
  my_column <- enquo(my_column)
  
  my_data %>%
  group_by(!!my_column) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_injuries=sum(n_injuries)) %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(-number_of_injuries) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(reorder(!!my_column, number_of_injuries), number_of_injuries)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+  
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of injuries") 
  }

# Change diagnosis to body_part, location or sex 
# to see if the function is working properly
injury_data %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(diagnosis)

```


## Home sweet home

```{r byloc_img, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap="http://www.getliquid.com/news/2011/3/9/housing-costs-going-through-the-roof.html", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://static.squarespace.com/static/52f3ac0ae4b014c84ab04f80/53586543e4b03ef5a934b13f/53586543e4b03ef5a934b284/1299650336367/1000w/breaking-through-the-roof.jpg")
```

We now know that most injuries happen at home! Let's explore what products are involved with home injuries. 

To get these results we first need to **filter** our results where location of the injury is "Home".

Look at the code below. Discuss with your group what is new in the code (other than our home made function `plot_injury_grp_top10`).

```{r home_prod, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=5}
# Run the code to see top 10 products involved in home injuries
injury_data %>%
  filter(location == "Home") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(product)
```

```{r home_prod-hint}
# Run the code to see top 10 products involved in home injuries
injury_data %>%
  filter(location == "Home") %>% # <-- line is added to filter data!
  plot_injury_grp_top10(product)
```

**Since many of you spend most of your time at school, let's also see what products are involved in injures that happen at schools!**

Look at code below, change it to get the same results for school.

```{r school_prod, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=15}
# Change the code to see top 10 products involved in school injuries
injury_data %>%
  filter(location == "Home") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(product)
```

```{r school_prod-hint}
# Change the "Home" to "School"
```

```{r school_prod-solution}
# Change the code to see top 10 products involved in school injuries
injury_data %>%
  filter(location == "School") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(product)
```

**Do you think these results are surprising? Discuss with your group.**

**Extra:** Try other locations in the dataset: `r unique(injury_data$location)`

## Watch out!

Now let's try to figure out what products we should beware of at Home and at School.

- I'm a women in late 20s, let's see what I should beware of at home. Which means I will filter the dataset based on:   
 1. My age group (25-35 years old)    
 1. My sex (female)   
 1. My location (home)
 
```{r wout, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=7}
# Run the code to find out what product could be involved in my injury.
injury_data %>%
  filter(between(age, 25, 35),
         sex == "Female",
         location == "Home") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(product)
```
 
See if you got it right! 
 
```{r wout1-quiz}
quiz(
  question(
    "Which product is most likely be involved if I'm injured at home?",
    answer("Beds"),
    answer("Bathtub"),
    answer("Stairs", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Doors"),
    random_answer_order = TRUE
  )
)
```

Now try the same for yourself first at home then at school. Change your age group to "teens" (11-18 years).

```{r wout_them, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=7}
# Change the code to find out 
# what product could be involved in your injury at home.
injury_data %>%
  filter(between(age, 25, 35),
         sex == "Female",
         location == "Home") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(product)
```

```{r wout_them-hint}
# Change the conditions for the filter!
# injury_data %>%
#   filter(between(age, ____, ______),
#          sex == "_____",
#          location == "_____") %>%
#   plot_injury_grp_top10(product)

```

```{r wout_them-hint-solution}
# Change the conditions for the filter!
injury_data %>%
  filter(between(age, 11, 18),
         sex == "Female",
         location == "Home") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(product)

```

**Are your results different than mine? Discuss with your group.**

Also try for results at school!

```{r wout_school, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=7}
# Change the code to find out 
# what product could be involved in your injury at home.
injury_data %>%
  filter(between(age, 25, 35),
         sex == "Female",
         location == "Home") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(product)
```

```{r wout_school-solution}
# Change the conditions for the filter!
injury_data %>%
  filter(between(age, 11, 18),
         sex == "Female",
         location == "School") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(product)

```

## Red White & BOOM!

```{r frwrks_img, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.cap="http://www.medicalwesthospital.org/fireworks-safety.php", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://www.medicalwesthospital.org/tyfoon/site/fckeditor/image/fireworks21.jpg")
```


We all love fireworks, it's a great way to celebrate Fourth of July! But if not handled carefully, fireworks can be big problem! Let's explore injuries related to fireworks.

We all know, we don't get to see fireworks all the time, in the winter for example no one would like to stay outside in the cold and watch the fireworks. Let's see if we can see some changes in firework injuries over the 5 years between 2013 and 2017.

**Run the code below and discuss the results with your group. Why do you think we are seeing those peaks?**

```{r frwrks_ex1, exercise=TRUE}
# Run the code below to see number of firework injuries over months
injury_data %>%
  filter(product == "fireworks") %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(number_of_injuries = sum(n_injuries)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, number_of_injuries)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "3 months" , date_labels = "%b") +
  xlab("Months") +
  ylab("Number of injuries")

```

**Let's see if there's a difference between sexes. Discuss the result with your group.**

```{r frwrks_sex, exercise=TRUE}
injury_data %>% 
  filter(product == "fireworks") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(sex)

```


**What about the age distribution?**

```{r frwrks_ex2, exercise=TRUE}
injury_data %>% 
  filter(product == "fireworks") %>%
  pull(age) %>%
  hist(breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Age")
```

What we see here is a histogram! It's a very useful kind of data visualization and used *a lot* in data analytics! Can you interpret what it's showing?

If you're not familiar with histograms, here's a nice video that explains it nicely.

**Finally, let's see how often the fire department was involved in firework accidents.**

```{r frwrks_ex3, exercise=TRUE}
injury_data %>% 
  filter(product == "fireworks") %>%
  plot_injury_grp_top10(fire_dept)
```

Did this result surprise you?

## Last words

I hope you enjoyed your time with me today! 
R is an open source programming language, which means you can install it to your computer for free and do all sorts of statistical analyses with it. Let me know if you are interested in learning more about R!
